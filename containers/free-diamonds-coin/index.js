                <div className='text-xl font-bold'>1. Free Fire Events:</div>
                <div>Garena frequently hosts special events where players can earn free diamonds by completing certain tasks or missions.

                <div className='text-xl font-bold'>2. Google Opinion Rewards:</div>

                <div className='text-xl font-bold'>3. Redeem Codes:</div>

                <div>Certain membership programs like the Booyah Pass or the Elite Pass offer diamonds as part of the rewards for logging in and completing missions daily. Even without purchasing a pass, logging into Free Fire daily may reward you with free diamonds over time.</div>

                <div className='text-xl font-bold'>5. Spin the Luck Royale:</div>
                <div>Free Fire features a Luck Royale system where players can spend diamonds for a chance to win valuable items, including diamonds themselves. Although the chances are low, participating in the Luck Royale can sometimes grant free diamonds or other premium rewards.</div>

                <div>By leveraging these methods, players can earn free diamonds and unlock a variety of rewards to enhance their Free Fire experience.</div>
